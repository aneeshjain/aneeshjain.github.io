<h2>Cadence Solutions</h2>

  <h3>ML Engineering Intern</h3>
  
  *May 2022 - Present*
  
  *Automated evaluation of clinical reports for hypertensive patients using Neural Question Answering*
  * Utilized technologies like **NLP**, **(Named Entity Recigniton)NER**, **OCR**, **Redis**, **Python** and **AWS**, to design, develop, and deploy an advanced **ML** solution for medical report parsing.
  * Significantly improved operational efficiency, saving an estimated **50 work hours** per week of clinician time since reports were originally manually perused.
  * Increased patient enrollment by **100%** by virtue of processing a higher volume of documents and more accurate patient identification.

<h2>Virginia Tech</h2>

  <h3>Research Assistant</h3>

  *Aug 2021 - Dec 2022*
  <!-- * Released a **novel, large, parallel** programming language dataset to foster Deep Learning research in **code search, translation, summarization and synthesis**; presented benchmarks for all tasks([GitHub](https://github.com/reddy-lab-code-research/XLCoST), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/xlcost-text-to-code)).
  * Developed a **Reinforcement Learning(RL)** algorithm and reward function in **PyTorch**, that uses code compilation signal, syntax trees and data flow graphs as feedback to improve **code translation** quality.
  * Achieved a **6.5%** improvement in the compilation rate of generated translations using the RL algorithm.
  * Developed an **evaluation** framework for code translation quality using **Python** which **automated compilation, test
  generation and execution**. -->

  * Successfully released a **novel** and extensive **parallel** programming language dataset to drive innovative Deep Learning research in the areas of **code search, translation, summarization, and synthesis**. Presented comprehensive benchmarks to showcase its potential([GitHub](https://github.com/reddy-lab-code-research/XLCoST), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/xlcost-text-to-code)).
  * Designed and implemented a state-of-the-art **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithm and corresponding reward function in **PyTorch**, leveraging syntax trees and data flow graphs to enhance the syntactic accuracy of code translations.
  * Improved code translation quality by a remarkable **6.5%** through the application of the RL algorithm and innovative feedback mechanisms, such as code compilation signals.
  * Created a comprehensive evaluation framework for code translation quality in **Python**, automating processes such as compilation, test generation, and execution for a streamlined and efficient evaluation process.

<h2>Unilever</h2>

  <h3>Project Lead</h3>

  *Jul 2019 - Jun 2020*
  * Led a team of 3 engineers to build data pipelines for parsing financial documents using OCR.
  * End-to-end Project Management – planning sprints, designing solutions and negotiating costs.

  <h3>Software Development Intern</h3>

  *Aug 2018 - Dec 2018*

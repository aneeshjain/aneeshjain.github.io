<div style="text-align: right">
I am a recent Master's graduate from the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu). As graduate student I wrote my thesis in Deep Learning for Code Generation and AI assisted Software Development, under the guidance of [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~reddy/). My current research interests broadly include Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and Understanding. I also have experience with with information retrieval. Im looking for opportunities to work on challenging and stimulating problems within the field of machine learning. In addition to conducting research, I am interested in working on projects that implement and deploy that research on a large scale, as well as owning the full lifecycle of the machine learning pipeline, including data ingestion, model serving and maintenance.

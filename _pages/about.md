I am a recent Master's graduate from the Department of COmputer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu). As graduate student I wrote my thesis in Deep Learning for Code Generation and AI assisted Software Development, under the guidance of [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~reddy/). My current research interests broadly include Deep Learning for Natural Language Procrssing and Understading. I also have some experience with with information retrieval. Im looking for opportunities to work on challenging and stimulating problems within the field of machine learning. In addition to conducting research, I am also interested in developing the skills necessary to implement and deploy that research on a large scale, as well as being responsible for the full lifecycle of the machine learning pipeline, including data ingestion, model serving and maintenance. 

If you'd like to collaborate on something, please reach out!
